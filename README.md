## Project Folder Structure:

At this stage, we will have two folders:

- `components`: Which contains all reusable components.
- `containers`: Which contains components that handle components logics and states.
- `data`: Which contains some files with static data in.
- `pages`: For all pages which are components but not used more than once.
